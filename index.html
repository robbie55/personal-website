        <h2>Yo!</h2>
        <p>
          Lets talk me. I'm a nineteen year-old looking to jumpstart his life!
          I'm taking some courses and using some resources to build up my
          skills, which are a bit lackluster at the moment. My goal is to become
          a leader of a business that creates impact on a global level. Huge
          goal right? Even if the results aren't exactly how I imagined they'd
          be, the process will turn me into a man that will find success
          wherever I invest myself.

          <h3>Sales</h3>
          <p>
            This is an area where I have literally zero experience. If this were
            an RPG game, I'd still be in the character creation phase. However I
            am working to boost this skill up. The ability to sell a business,
            an idea, a person, or even myself is invaluable in the work space I
            plan to dominate in. As such, I'm working with some connections to
            get some experience ASAP!

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            Programming and I have an off and on relationship. For almost four
            years, I have attempted to pick up this skill and have eventually
            let it go after a month or so. I could give you a list of excuses,
            but the truth of it was comfort. Too much comfort. Now, I've hedged
            all my bets in myself, and with any form of betting there is risk.
            Despite this risk I'm confident in my current abilities to put my
            head down and work to further my programming day in and day out for
            the rest of my career.
